                        <div>The Patriots, originally known as Cipher, also known as the La-li-lu-le-lo (らりるれろ),
                            were a secret organization that, by the early 1990s, covertly controlled the United
                            States of America. The group was formed to fulfill the ideal of a unified world that
                            was envisioned by the legendary soldier The Boss and later sought to control the
                            entire world to ensure this. <br><br>
                            The Legacy was stolen from the DCI at the climax of Gene's rebellion by the Philosophers'
                            former agent Ocelot (under Zero's orders). Before killing the DCI, Ocelot proclaimed that
                            [he and Zero] were going to "end [the Philosophers], take back what [the DCI] stole from
                            [him and Zero], and carry on the spirit of the true patriot", explaining that it was,
                            "all part of our plan to make the world [The Boss] envisioned a reality."
                            After Ocelot's intense speech, he executed the DCI in a way that looked like a suicide.
                            Zero later contacted Ocelot and invited him to form part of his new organization.
                            Ocelot agreed under the condition that Big Boss (Naked Snake) joined the organization as well. <br><br>
                            <i>"Politics, the military, the economy they control it all. They even choose who becomes President. Putting it simply, the Patriots rule this country."</i><br>
